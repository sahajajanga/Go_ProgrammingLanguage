#install GO tool for local device Mac/Windows/Linux from below website.

#Go Playground is free but it runs on sandbox of GO 
#Hence it limits the usage of this tool, with certain specific date and time on server always bieng NOV 10, 2009, 11PM.
#Also limits file system or coding anything which needs external connection, so for full package level control you would need a local installation of Go. 

#Go playground is always helpful to check if your code is in working condition or not before including in your source code. 
# Link to Go Playground : https://play.golang.org/

#After installing Go to your local, On MAC, go to finder, Go- connect to server - type in location: /usr/local/go 
# I wasn't able to cd directly to this location, not sure why though. 

bin folder inside /usr/local/go/bin has executables go - compiler , godoc - for documentation management, gofmt - for code formatting. 

export $PATH on mac gave me output of including go/bin in its path by default. 

typing go in terminal should get you up and running. Output looks as below:
